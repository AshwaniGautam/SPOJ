# SPOJ-

This is a repository of all the SPOJ problems which i have successfully solved!
For some problem i have tried all the alternative(different algorithms) known to me.
Use the codes as you wish. I will not be responsible for any loss done to you in any sense.

TLE solutions
	1) Nakanj.py
	
NOT IMPLEMENTED
	1) SQFREE.cpp
	
Changed/modified some solutions, so can't assure that they will give AC "as is", but they are almost fine.
